## Hey there - I'm Will 👋 

Looks like you've stumbled upon my GitHub page.

I'm a coder hailing from the beautiful city of Stockholm, where I mostly tinker with distributed system design and relentlessly pursue engineering efficiency. During my workdays, you'll probably find me drowning in YAML files and sketching diagrams. So, it's safe to say that I've earned a tiny bit of sympathy. 😅

If fate has made me your "boss" or, for some other cosmic reason, you need to "endure my [expletive deleted]", do yourself a favor and check out my [README](https://github.com/williamhogman/working-with-will/blob/master/README.org) file. It's your survival guide! 📚

Topics I can't stop talking about (you've been warned):
- Kubernetes 🌐
- Clojure 🔮
- Emacs ⌨️
- Startups 🚀


Feel free to connect with me, share your thoughts. I'm always up for an engaging conversation! Also, don't hesitate to explore my repos or collaborate on a project. I'm always up for hacking some code together.

When I'm not buried in code, you can find me exploring the outdoors, whipping up culinary masterpieces, or tending to my garden. If you share any of these interests, we'll have even more to chat about!

Don't be a stranger – feel free to reach out and say hi! You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/w_hgm), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/whnse), or shoot me an [email](mailto:me@whn.se).

Happy coding! 💻
