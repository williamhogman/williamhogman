Hello there looks like you found my Github page.

I'm a coder based out of Stockholm ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º, I work mostly on distributed system design and engineering efficiency. At work I spend most of my time writing YAML-files and drawing diagrams, I therefore feel that I'm deserving of atleast some measure of pity.

I'm currently working on a reactive data-lake, whatever that is. If you want to hear a rambling pitch on why it is awesome let me know.

If I happen to be your "boss" or you for some other reason have to "deal with my [expletive deleted]" you should read my [README](https://github.com/williamhogman/working-with-will/blob/master/README.org`) file.

Things I talk too much about:
- Kubernetes
- Clojure
- Emacs
- Startups
